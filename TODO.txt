Must:
x Show upload errors (add specific type error)
x Single image/file selector
x Multiple image/file selector
x Filter image or document

Need:
x Test on IE 11
x Delete
x Create folders
x Open folder
x Cut and paste files
x Upload to folder

Nice:
- Delete folder
- Edit folder name
- Soft delete all files
- Model
- Translations
- Configure URL's
- Delete message listener tag
- Download button
- List and sort by file type
- Upload progress bar
- Cut and paste folders (+cycle detection)
- Local storage cache
- Keyboard controls
? Edit form + file replace (optional)
? File usage page
? Directory namer based on date or PK
X Directory cache
X Document icons (word pdf etc)



Issues:
x delete folder -> folder not found -> should return a json error object instead of a Symfony error page
x symfony validator returns after first error, so only the first error is sent to the client, but the client is setup to receive an array of errors
x recycle bin should be implemented on server
x the selected files can be stored in multiple folders -> if all files in folder A are deselected, but in folder B some files are still selected, you can't delete the files in folder


Roadmap:

x redux version without local cache
x redux version with local cache
