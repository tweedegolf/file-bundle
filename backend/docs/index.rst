Symfony-Okoa Documentation
==========================


Welcome to a Symfony-Okoa project! In this documentation we'll help you get on
your way. The Symfony-Okoa project is mostly based upon the Symfony-Standard
project but we've chosen to do a few things a little different. The
documentation will mostly describe these changes and how to work with the
project.
