Terminology
===========

Container
    Depending on context this can mean one of two things. Firstly inside the
    Symfony application the container, or more preferably the depenency
    injection container, is responsible for instantiating objects for usage
    throughout your application.

    Secondly a container may also reference a software container. In the context
    of running this application you will find this term is used. A container is
    a form of virtualization. In contrast to virtual machines a container
    reuses the kernel (core) of the host operating system. This allows it to
    run with less overhead and start much more quickly compared to virtual
    machines.
